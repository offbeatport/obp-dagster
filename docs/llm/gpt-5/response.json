                'access restricted hearing information need to subscribe to '
                'hearing lists in a way that matches their needs — by '
                'language/version, list type, or specific case identifiers '
                '(case name, reference number, URN). Right now the '
                'subscription workflow is fragmented or too coarse: users '
                'either get broad, noisy emails, must repeatedly check a '
                'portal, or rely on manual help from administrators. That '
                'blocks the core workflow of timely, targeted delivery of '
                'sensitive hearing updates to the right recipients.\n'

                'Teams currently try ad-hoc approaches: sending bulk emails to '
                'manually curated lists, offering a single toggle '
                'subscribe/unsubscribe per user, or asking users to manually '
                'scan dashboards for new lists. Those approaches fail because '
                "they can't express fine-grained filters (language variants, "
                "list kinds), don't support subscribing by case-level "
                'identifiers, produce duplicate or irrelevant notifications, '
                'and give no reliable unsubscribe/audit trail. Publishers’ '
                'manual processes (confirming uploads, choosing which list '
                'version to send) are error-prone and create mismatch between '
                'what was published and what subscribers expect.\n'

                'This hurts journalists, legal representatives, court admin '
                'teams and any organization that relies on targeted delivery '
                'of restricted notices. The pain is worst during busy '
                'publication cycles or multi-jurisdiction rollouts when many '
                'lists and versions are published daily — users either miss '
                'important updates or are overwhelmed by noise. Downstream '
                'consequences include missed reporting deadlines, operational '
                'overhead for support teams, potential breaches of access '
                'rules, and damaged trust between publishers and verified '

                'Technically, a robust solution must integrate with the '
                'verified-user identity/approval flow, support complex '

                'identifiers), handle scheduled and manual publishing '
                'workflows, deduplicate and throttle notifications, and '
